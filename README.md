# Accepted API

This is a simple API with two endpoints to allow you to get data for four-year colleges in the United States.

To receive all the data on all the colleges at once, send a GET request to:
```
http://acceptedapi.herokuapp.com/api/v1/colleges
```

To see the data for one particular college, send a GET request to:

```
http://acceptedapi.herokuapp.com/api/v1/colleges/:id
```
